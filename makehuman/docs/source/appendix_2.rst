Sections
===============

Section headers are created by underlining (and optionally overlining) the section title with a punctuation character, at least as long as the text:

::

	===================
	My Section Title
	===================
	
In Python documentation, there is the following convetional hierarchy:


    * # with overline, for parts
    * \* with overline, for chapters
    * =, for sections
    * -, for subsections
    * ^, for subsubsections
    * ", for paragraphs
