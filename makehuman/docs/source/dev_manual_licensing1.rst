Preamble
************

Licensing is a complex matter, particularly for software and data intended to be free and widely reusable, such as is the case with MakeHumanÂ©. Most Copyright law is oriented heavily towards protecting commercial interests, so using this law to give you rights while protecting you from rights acquired by others is a delicate balancing act. The intention of the MakeHuman team is to license the reuse of its Copyright materials, free or charge, both commercially and non-commercially. Standard time-tested licenses have been used to attempt to bring clarity to this complex legal issue.

The MakeHuman Mesh licensing paragraph below has been particularly delicately worded so as to try to afford you extensive and wide ranging authority over creative works that you produce while attempting to avoid that the use of MakeHuman by others places unnecessary restrictions upon you. 

MakeHuman uses a standardized mesh topology which is deformed using standard deformation algorithms (morph targets). Files exported by different artists therefore often bear a great many similarities. It is the intention of the MakeHuman team that you should be able to copyright your own, sufficiently unique or distinct artistic works, without overly constraining other MakeHuman users who will be using very similar meshes.
