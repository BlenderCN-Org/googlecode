*******************
The MakeHuman Mesh
*******************

The MakeHuman application uses a 3D mesh to represent human figures. This mesh was developed in a number of successive iterations (see The Humanoid Mesh) over a number of years to support a diverse range of physiological variants and pose-based deformations. The application uses a mesh with a standard topology (how the vertices, edges and faces relate to one another), which is manipulated by applying standard morph targets (mesh deformations).

The specific data files used to define and deform the mesh, distributed with the MakeHuman application are covered by the terms of the GNU General Public License 3.0 and you are granted permission to use and redistribute those files in original or modified form under those terms. These data files can also be manipulated using the Blender MakeTarget script, but they, and derivative works remain under the terms of the GNU GPL.

When you export, save, or in any way convert a MakeHuman data file, you may store any deformations that you have applied/created, along with the topology of the base mesh and any positional information that you have not materially changed. You are the Copyright holder of changes that you have made. The MakeHuman Team retains Copyright over the topology and the base mesh, but grants you permission to copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the generated materials over which they hold Copyright (except the case of using the exports to create commercial software mimicking MakeHuman’s features), including the topology and positional information constituting the base mesh provided that this does not prevent others from doing the same.

You do not acquire exclusive Copyright over the topology or positional information constituting the base mesh, so others can, in perpetuity also create works derived from the topology and positional information constituting the base mesh and the morph target data used to deform the base MakeHuman mesh. Note that you may be able to establish copyright over works that you produce using the MakeHuman application if your work is sufficiently unique or distinct. The definition of how unique and distinct a work needs to be to be copyrightable is jurisdiction dependent and can vary over time as legal systems evolve and adapt to new legal challenges.

You own any 2D images that you create using exported MakeHuman mesh data and any copyright that applicable law affords you over those materials. Note that the definition of how unique and distinct a work needs to be to be copyrightable is jurisdiction dependent and can vary over time as legal systems evolve and adapt to new legal challenges.

The essentials of the MakeHuman license for content creators
***************************************************************

The text below describes a way to setup a commercial usage scenario for Artwork created with MakeHuman or based on MakeHuman assets.

The text shall help you to understand without doubts the implications of the MakeHuman license. So here is what you as content creator can/should do and what you will need to tell your customers what they can do with the purchased content. Feel free to reuse parts or the whole text for your particular usage scenario:

The content creator

* can use content made with and exported from MakeHuman as a base for further processing with other tools (e.g. with blender).
* can freely sell content based on MakeHuman for any price and as often as he/she wants.
* is free (but not obliged) to publish the sources of his/her creations. (the export files generated by MakeHuman, .obj, etc...)
* is obliged to include a copy of the MakeHuman License with the export files generated by MakeHuman.
* is obliged to state "this content is based on the MakeHuman mesh" at a clearly visible place to address the MakeHuman copyright.
* is free to add his/her own copyright to the creation regarding all changes from the makeHuman base mesh which can not be done within MakeHuman.
* is free to restrict the usage of his/her content regarding reproduction and reselling of the content that was purchased from him/her.
* may not use the exports to create commercial software mimicking MakeHuman’s features.

Purchased content may not be reproduced/further processed/resold without prior permission from the content creator.
Purchasers of any content based on MakeHuman are still allowed to use MakeHuman itself to create/sell their own content.
Purchased content may not be used to create commercial software mimicking makehuman’s features.
