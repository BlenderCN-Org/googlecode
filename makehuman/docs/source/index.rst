Preface
=========

This manual, like the MakeHuman software, is under constant construction and will change with the software. The latest edition can always be found on the makehuman website. MakeHuman is a 3d modeling tool which is build for one single purpose:
creating a professional 3d human model. 

While the software is build with usability and simplicity in mind, there will always be questions, thatâ€™s what Part I of this manual is for. It is modeled on the application and follows the menu system and options closely. 

Part II focuses on developing with MakeHuman, to create your own plugin and add functionality to the main application. This manual is provided under an Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivs 3.0 Unported (CC BY-NC-ND 3.0) license_.

Part 2: Developers guide
-------------------------

This document is the 'Developers Guide' for the MakeHuman application and covers key aspects of the development environment configuration and setup on the various supported platforms (Windows, Mac OS X and GNU/Linux). 

It also contains the coding standards required to develop consistently high-quality code for the MakeHuman project and details key features of the Application Programming Interface that MakeHuman developers and Plugin developers can use to maintain and extend the product.

It largely relates to the development of new features but also contains general build instructions that you may find useful if you are attempting to build a copy of the application to run on a platform that is not officially supported.

To extend the software with new features and write a plugins, **it'is comfortable the knowledge of python and the reading of first chapter**. The second chapter contains detailed information about the Python engine written in C, and it's intended for developers that want to touch the core of MH only.
