Welcome to MakeHuman python API documentation
=============================================

This document is the 'Developers Guide' for the MakeHuman application and covers key aspects of the development environment configuration and setup on the various supported platforms (Windows, Mac OS X and GNU/Linux). It also contains the coding standards required to develop consistently high-quality code for the MakeHuman project and details key features of the Application Programming Interface that MakeHuman developers and Plugin developers can use to maintain and extend the product.
It largely relates to the development of new features but also contains general build instructions that you may find useful if you are attempting to build a copy of the application to run on a platform that is not officially supported.

The MakeHuman project is an open source project developed, managed and maintained by voluntary efforts. It is hosted on http://code.google.com/p/makehuman/ where the current source code is available for download from the SVN repository. An earlier CVS repository has been retained for reference purposes, but is no longer maintained.
