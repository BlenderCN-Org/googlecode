Preface
=========

This manual, like the MakeHuman software, is under constant construction and will change with the software. The latest edition can always be found on the makehuman website. MakeHuman is a 3d modeling tool which is build for one single purpose: creating a professional 3d human model. 

While the software is build with usability and simplicity in mind, there will always be questions, thatâ€™s what Part I of this manual is for. It is modeled on the application and follows the menu system and options closely. 

Part II focuses on developing with MakeHuman, to create your own plugin and add functionality to the main application.
