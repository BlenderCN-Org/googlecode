Measure
=========

Measure has sliders which modify the length and/or circumference of speciﬁc body
parts and shows the length and/or circumference of many body parts in centimeters.
You can change the units to inches in Settings. Note that modifying one parameter
might have impact on other measurements too.

Asymmetry
============

Sometimes a perfect symmetric model is not what is desired. Asymmetry can make
some features of the model’s face or body asymmetric.

Randomize
==========

When a lot of different models are needed, or some inspiration is needed, it is some-
times better to let the pseudorandom generator decide how the macro modeling is done.
An existing model can also be modiﬁed by randomization of its macro features.
