The MHX format allows us to export a rigged, textured and dressed character to Blender. To export Alia as an MHX file, press the Files, Export buttons.  Choose the .mhx Export option; for our purpose, the .bvh and group options 
are unimportant, nor does it matter whether Hair is exported as a mesh or as curves. Type in the name of character and press Save. 

To do: options descrition.
