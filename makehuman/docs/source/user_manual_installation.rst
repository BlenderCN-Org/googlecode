Installation of MakeHuman
*****************************


The Alpha 4 release of MakeHuman installers are available for Windows, Mac OS X and Linux.

You will need about 30 MB of disk space for the installer and a further 100MB of disk space for the application code. Once installation is complete you can delete the installer file to recover the disk space that it occupies. It is recommended that you run MakeHuman on a machine with at least 512MB of memory and at least a 800MHz processor.

If you don't have Windows, Linux or OSX, you may still be able to build, run and use this application. The MakeHuman source code is available to enable you to perform a build of your own. This requires a bit more effort, additional knowledge and compilation tools. 

Windows
========

To install the MakeHuman files, download the MakeHuman Windows installer from the MakeHuman Web site and execute it. Run the application from Windows Start menu.

Mac OS X
=========

A zipped package which contains a Universal Binary of MakeHuman is available for Mac OS X 10.5 (aka. Leopard). Note that this version of MakeHuman does not run on Versions prior to Mac OS X 10.5!

Download the archive and unzip it into a separate directory on your file system and unpack its Application Bundle named MakeHuman.app. A good location for this is the folder Application but this is not mandatory.

Finally you may start MakeHuman by double clicking the Applications icon.

Linux
=====

.deb packages are available for both 32- and 64-bit versions of Ubuntu 8.10. Download and run the file appropriate for your version. The installation process will be started. After the installation, Makehuman will be available in the applications menu.
