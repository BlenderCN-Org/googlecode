What's Makehuman?
===================

Makehuman |copy| released under Open Source License (GPL3.0) is innovative and professional software for purpose of very quickly creating (less than 2 minutes) high quality photorealistic humanoid characters.

Features
========

An Intuitive GUI
---------------------

The GUI uses modeling controls and a number of ‘intelligent’ tools to help minimize the learning curve for new user while providing powerful features to enable all users to rapidly model a character that meets their needs. These controls include: Ethnicity, Gender, Age, Muscle Tone and Body Mass.

Our tools have intelligence built-in. For example, when a female figure is being modeled (as defined by the Gender tool), then body mass is added to the model (as defined by the Weight tool), it is added to the model in the same areas where women typically accumulate fat.

A Professional Mesh
---------------------------

All MakeHuman humanoid figures are based on a single, highly optimized, light and professional mesh. Modeling of the mesh is performed by deforming the mesh as opposed to altering its topology. 

Artist have created numerous mesh deformation targets, as realistic starting points for you to use as you model particular ethnic, gender, age and body mass figures.

The mesh supports subdivision to enable higher density, smoothed meshes to be exported for high quality rendering.

Python Scripting
----------------------

The MakeHuman application has been structured to expose a great many of the program internals through the Application Programming Interface (API). This open structure has been documented and published to encourage the development of new scripts and plugin functionality that will help the application to develop and rapidly adapt to the needs of the user community.

External rendering
-------------------------

MakeHuman incorporates a range of plugins to export a modeled and posed figure in 3D graphics formats supported by a very wide range of external modelers and rendering engines. These export functions have been written as Python plugins that can easily be extended and can serve as examples to enable other interfaces to be readily constructed.

Support for Aqsis, the officially supported Renderman format renderer, is built into the MakeHuman application. However, export to other formats and other renderers are also provided.
