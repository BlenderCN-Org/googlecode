The 'Modeling' button on the top toolbar takes you into Modeling Mode. This is the default mode that appears when the application starts. This mode is used to control the anatomy of the human figure. MakeHuman provides controls ranging from course-grain to fine-grain for defining anatomy.

A common modeling technique is to model generic attributes first, such as age, ethnicity and gender and then to work down into greater detail, modeling individual body parts and then specific detailed features. MakeHuman is structured to make it very easy to follow this pattern of working.

Macro modeling
===============

Macro modeling is the roughest step in modeling a human, but it also has the biggest impact on the resulting mesh. Macro modeling has 5 sliders. The ﬁrst 4 sliders modify the 4 main dimensions of the human: gender, age, muscle and weight. 

The last slider, height, modiﬁes the proportions. The functionality of the gender and age sliders are straightforward. Gender goes from female to male, initially it is at 50% of each, which gives a neutral gender. 

Age goes from 12 years old to 70 years old, initially it is at 25 years old. The muscle and weight sliders inﬂuence each other. Only increasing muscle you doesn't create a bodybuilder, that also requires weight. 

Similarly only increasing weight doesn't create a really fat model, that also requires less muscle. Finally as said before the height slider doesn't just scale the model vertically, but it changes the

Measure
=========

Measure has sliders which modify the length and/or circumference of speciﬁc body parts and shows the length and/or circumference of many body parts in centimeters.

You can change the units to inches in Settings. Note that modifying one parameter might have impact on other measurements too.

Asymmetry
============

Sometimes a perfect symmetric model is not what is desired. Asymmetry can make
some features of the model’s face or body asymmetric.

Randomize
==========

When a lot of different models are needed, or some inspiration is needed, it is some-
times better to let the pseudorandom generator decide how the macro modeling is done.
An existing model can also be modiﬁed by randomization of its macro features.
