Shader
==========

MakeHuman can make use of GLSL shaders to give a better preview of how the model
will look when rendered.

Slider behavior
=================

MakeHuman does not require a very fast computer, though some operations might be
too heavy for some systems. Turning off normal recalculation or turning off real-time
updates completely might help in making MakeHuman usable on low-end systems.

Mouse behavior
==================

This allows you to ﬁne-tune the speed of moving the model using the mouse. Both the
normal speed and the speed when holding down shift can be modiﬁed.

Units
=========

Metric or imperial units can be chosen. Note that imperial units will use inches through-
out the program, also for longer lengths.

Shortcuts
=============

All shortcuts can be customized.

Censor
=======

To do.
