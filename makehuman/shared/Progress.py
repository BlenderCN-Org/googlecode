Abstract
--------

The Progress module defines the Progress class, which provides an easy
and versatile way to handle MH's progress bar.

It takes care automatically for subroutines,
so that the programmer can avoid passing progress callbacks,
and only state the subroutine's impact on the progress, out of it.
