Abstract
--------

The Progress module defines the Progress class, which provides an easy
and versatile way to handle MH's progress bar.

It takes care automatically for subroutines,
so that the programmer can avoid passing progress callbacks,
and only state the subroutine's impact on the progress, out of it.

*-- Usage --*

import Progress


# Standard usage.

def foo():
    progress = Progress.Progress()

    ... # do stuff #
    progress(0.7)
    ... # more stuff #
    progress(1.0)


# Usage in steps.

def bar():
    progress = Progress.Progress(12)

    ... # step 1 #
    progress.step()
    ... # step 2 #
    progress.step()
    ....
    ....
    ... # step 12 #
    progress.step()


# Usage in loops.

def baz(items):
    progress = Progress.Progress(len(items))

    for item in items:
        ... # do stuff #
        progress.substep(0.3)
        ... # more stuff #
        progress.substep(0.6)
        ... # even more stuff #
        progress.step()


# All together!!!
# (ie. time consuming functions that include
#  subroutines in them, that may have their own progress handler.)
# [This example shows the use of descriptions too.]

def FooBarBaz():
    progress = Progress.Progress()

    progress(0, 0.3, "Getting some foo")
    somefoo = foo()

    progress(0.3, 0.7, "Getting two bars", 2)
    bar1 = bar()
    bar2 = bar()

    progress(0.7, 0.99, "Bazzing them all together")
    bazzable = [somefoo, bar1, bar2]
    baz(bazzable)

    progress(1.0, None, "I've finished bazzing. Call me bazzer.")


----

Note: Progress is newbie-proof, ie. if you tell it that you'll
      call bar() 2 times (like above) and you call it 4,
      it won't explode, but when you call the 3rd bar(), it will
      start counting progress again from the point it was before you
      called the first bar() [which actually might be useful as a hack].
      It also has no problem if you call it only 1 time, it will just do
      the half progress to the next step, then jump to 0.7 of baz().
